        <p> In a first of a kind initiative in India, the Jamshedpur Utilities and Services Company (JUSCO) was carved out of Tata Steel from its Town Services Division in 2004. In JUSCO, the steel major reposed nine decades of experience and expertise. The mandate for JUSCO was to convert an obligatory service into a customer focused sustainable corporate entity.</br>
            Jamshedpur Utilities & Services Company is today India’s only comprehensive urban infrastructure service provider. A Tata Enterprise, its services focus on the Tata Group Purpose “to improve the quality of life of the communities we serve”.</br>
            The Group purpose is reflected in JUSCO’s Mission of providing “quality services for life”. Its services include water, power, infrastructure, public health and horticulture services. JUSCO works alongside civic bodies, large and small industries, local government bodies, communities and individuals to deliver value through sustainable solutions.</br>
            The Company believes that a clear sense of the Tata Values and Mission allows it to achieve immense clarity on its role for the future. JUSCO intends to rise to the challenge of meeting India's need for infrastructure development in a sustainable manner by anticipating and addressing the country's growth needs such that the ability of future generations to meet their own needs is not compromised.</br>
